\## AI Behavior Guide



\### Detection System

The NextBot detects players based on:

\- \*\*Movement Speed\*\*: Faster movement increases detection chance

\- \*\*Weapon Fire\*\*: Shooting weapons immediately alerts the AI

\- \*\*Distance\*\*: Closer proximity increases detection probability

\- \*\*Line of Sight\*\*: Direct visual contact triggers aggressive behavior



\### Stealth Mechanics

\- \*\*Light Level\*\*: AI performs better in dark areas

\- \*\*Cover Usage\*\*: Actively seeks positions with good cover

\- \*\*Noise Discipline\*\*: Moves quietly and creates distractions

\- \*\*Environmental Control\*\*: Manipulates lights and props



\### Combat Behavior

\- \*\*Silent Takedowns\*\*: Attempts non-lethal takedowns when possible

\- \*\*Suppressed Fire\*\*: Uses quiet weapons to maintain stealth

\- \*\*Tactical Retreat\*\*: Withdraws when compromised or injured

\- \*\*Smoke Deployment\*\*: Uses smoke grenades to break contact



\## Client-Side Effects



\### Visual Effects

\- \*\*Stealth Particles\*\*: Blue glowing particles when highly stealthy

\- \*\*Tactical Display\*\*: 3D HUD showing AI state and objectives

\- \*\*Flash Effects\*\*: Screen distortion when using night vision

\- \*\*Stealth Indicator\*\*: Real-time stealth level visualization



\### Audio Effects

\- \*\*Whisper System\*\*: Psychological messages delivered to nearby players

\- \*\*Suppressed Gunfire\*\*: Realistic silenced weapon sounds

\- \*\*Environmental Audio\*\*: Footsteps and movement sounds



\## Compatibility



\### Requirements

\- \*\*Garry's Mod\*\*: Latest version recommended

\- \*\*Server/Client\*\*: Works on both dedicated servers and singleplayer

\- \*\*Map Compatibility\*\*: Works on all maps (navmesh enhances but not required)



\### Optional Integration

\- \*\*DRGBase\*\*: Enhanced display integration if DRGBase is present

\- \*\*Custom Maps\*\*: Performs better on maps with proper navmesh generation



\## Troubleshooting



\### Common Issues



\*\*NextBot appears in Entities instead of NPCs\*\*

\- Ensure `shared.lua` has `ENT.Type = "nextbot"`

\- Restart the server or reload the addon



\*\*Movement errors or stuck behavior\*\*

\- Check console for Path API errors

\- Ensure the map has proper navmesh generation

\- Try `nav\_generate` in console for better pathfinding



\*\*Client effects not working\*\*

\- Verify all files are properly uploaded to clients

\- Check network string registration in `init.lua`



\### Performance Issues

If experiencing lag:

\- Reduce `TACTICAL\_CONFIG` detection ranges

\- Increase AI update intervals in the timer

\- Limit the number of simultaneous NextBots



\## Customization



\### Modifying AI Behavior

Edit the tactical configuration in `init.lua` to adjust:

\- Detection ranges and sensitivity

\- Stealth mechanics and light preferences

\- Combat engagement rules

\- Retreat and reset conditions



\### Adding New States

To add custom AI states:

1\. Add new state to `AI\_STATES` table

2\. Implement state logic in `ExecuteTacticalAI()`

3\. Add transition conditions in `UpdateTacticalState()`

4\. Update client display in `cl\_init.lua`



\### Custom Models

To use different models:

1\. Change `ENT.Model` in `shared.lua`

2\. Update collision bounds in `Initialize()`

3\. Adjust animation sequences if needed

```



\### Advanced Configuration

For server administrators, you can modify the NextBot's behavior by editing the `TACTICAL\_CONFIG` table in `init.lua`. Common adjustments:



\*\*Make More Aggressive:\*\*

```lua

STEALTH\_RADIUS = 1200,     -- Larger detection range

PATIENCE\_TIMER = 2,        -- Less patience before state change

RETREAT\_HEALTH = 25,       -- Fight longer before retreating

```



\*\*Make More Stealthy:\*\*

```lua

STEALTH\_RADIUS = 400,      -- Smaller detection range

SHADOW\_PREFERENCE = 0.9,   -- Higher preference for darkness

WHISPER\_RADIUS = 300,      -- Larger psychological range

```



\*\*Performance Optimization:\*\*

```lua

STEALTH\_RADIUS = 600,      -- Moderate detection range

LIGHT\_DISABLE\_RANGE = 200, -- Smaller light manipulation range

```



Remember to restart the server or reload the addon after making changes to see the effects.
